<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve spent most of my career in startups which would go on to be acquired by Cisco (twice). As a cheap form of therapy, I&rsquo;m
collecting some of my &ldquo;learnings&rdquo; here.</p>
<h2 id="ancient-history">Ancient History</h2>
<p>I joined <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tandberg#Codian">Codian</a> in the summer of 2006. I was nearing completion of my PhD, had a one-year old child and far too much student debt.
I&rsquo;d decided that I didn&rsquo;t want to follow an academic career. Or maybe I just couldn&rsquo;t afford to bring up a family on a post-doc
stipend. Take your pick. I&rsquo;d been looking at the usual destinations for mathematics graduates (financial institutions etc) and it all
seemed a bit soulless.</p>
<p>A recruiter hooked me up with Codian; I was told that Codian made some kind of hi-fi equipment and were looking
for someone to write code <em>or something</em> (I couldn&rsquo;t believe this guy got kilopounds when I took the job). Turned out, Codian were a startup in video conferencing and were looking for
someone to automate their manufacturing test systems. Eventually. But I&rsquo;d have to <em>turn the handle</em> on some very hands on processes in the
day to day manufacturing of very specialised computer systems. As I automated things, I&rsquo;d free up time from manual labour which could be
used to do more automation and so on in a virtuous cycle.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be easy to rationalise why I joined with the hindsight of making some
money on acquisition, starting a career path in low-level systems programming and eventually security work but that&rsquo;d be just making up
a story. I joined because I didn&rsquo;t know any better. Could have easily been a disaster.</p>
<p>I learned a lot from Codian: some bad, much good. I got off to a good start.</p>
<h2 id="manufacturing-at-small-scale">Manufacturing at Small Scale</h2>
<p>Codian made <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multipoint_control_unit">MCUs</a> like this:</p>
<p><img src="/images/codian/4500.jpg" alt="Codian MCU 4500"></p>
<p>These are embedded systems with, for the time, a lot of DSP compute. Codian designed them, wrote software for them and built them (with help from specialist
manufacturers).</p>
<p>At the point I joined, all parts on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_of_materials">BOM</a> were purchased and stored in our manufacturing cave in <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@51.5086887,-0.5445945,3a,75y,36.62h,83.69t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sHxMLF51J5M3WYgaomPiGTg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656">Langley</a>. This was high-value,
low output manufacturing and it isn&rsquo;t entirely mental to be quite hands on in the early years. As builds were scheduled at our manufacturer, <a href="https://www.smselectronics.com/">SMS</a>, parts were picked (literally, by hand), boxed and sent via FedEx. Even the metal cases fabricated at our &ldquo;metal basher&rdquo; would be sent to us, stored, picked and sent on to SMS. Assembled systems would be delivered from SMS where we&rsquo;d perform testing by running various pieces of software and checking for errors (what I&rsquo;d been hired to improve). Finally, purchased systems would be packaged up and sent to customers. All this with a staff of three (including me) when I joined.</p>
<h2 id="life-choices">Life Choices</h2>
<p>Much of the goods-in came on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pallet">pallets</a> and by my first day we&rsquo;d amassed a large stockpile which was becoming a bit of a problem. My boss at the time gave me an electric sabre saw (we had a large collection of power tools for <em>reasons</em>) and told me to chop up the pallets and put them in the garbage. <em>This was my first assigned task in my new career</em>.</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;m in the car park on a nice sunny day having an amazingly good time dismembering pallets like I&rsquo;m Ash in <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106308/">Army of Darkness</a> . Some minutes in I&rsquo;m halfway through destroying
pallets when a truck appears and an irate (but salt of the earth) fella approaches me to ask why I&rsquo;m destroying <em>his</em> pallets. For a brief moment,
I thought he might punch me but I was apologetic and wielding a saw. I directed him to talk to my boss and went for lunch to ponder my life choices.</p>
<p>My first impressions of Codian were that it was chaos. In hindsight, I can see that it was order I&rsquo;d failed to understand. More on that later.</p>
