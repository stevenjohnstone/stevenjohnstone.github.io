<h2 id="protecting-secrets-in-home-with-apparmor">Protecting Secrets in Home With AppArmor</h2>
<p>Plenty of applications stash secrets in sub-directories of home. You may
not even notice as the directories are sometimes hidden e.g ~/.aws may contain
API keys for AWS. Firefox, for example, has
no real need to access API keys for cloud services
so I have added the following to /etc/apparmor.d/local/usr.bin.firefox:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell"><span class="c1"># Site-specific additions and overrides for usr.bin.firefox.</span>
<span class="c1"># For more details, please see /etc/apparmor.d/local/README.</span>

<span class="c1"># covers google and firebase credentials</span>
deny @<span class="o">{</span>HOME<span class="o">}</span>/.config/ rwmkl,
deny @<span class="o">{</span>HOME<span class="o">}</span>/.config/** rwmkl,
<span class="c1"># aws has its own directory</span>
deny @<span class="o">{</span>HOME<span class="o">}</span>/.aws/ rwmkl,
deny @<span class="o">{</span>HOME<span class="o">}</span>/.aws/** rwmkl,
</code></pre></div><p>When I use Firefox to browse files in my home dir, permission to access ~/.aws is denied because AppArmor prevents access as intended:</p>
<p><img src="/images/apparmorbypass/denied.png#center" alt="firefox permission denied"></p>
<p>The idea is to limit the impact of Firefox
being compromised.</p>
<h2 id="paths-and-namespaces">Paths and Namespaces</h2>
<p>I use <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/rootless/">rootless docker</a> which requires <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/user_namespaces.7.html">user
namespace</a> functionality to operate without
root. It&rsquo;s a huge improvement over the usual
insecure workflow with docker where any program running as an unprivileged user
can start up a container running as root with access to all system resources. As an extra layer of security, I was interested in writing an apparmor profile for docker
and the containers it launches which would
protect secrets in my home directory.</p>
<p>To test the profile, I made of copy of bash called &ldquo;bosh&rdquo; and wrote a basic profile which would
resemble what I had in mind for docker:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell"><span class="c1">#include &lt;tunables/global&gt;</span>
profile bosh /home/vagrant/bosh <span class="o">{</span>
  <span class="c1"># Allow all rules</span>
  capability,
  mount,
  file,
  unix,
  ptrace,
  /dev/pts/* rw,
  <span class="c1"># aws has its own directory</span>
  audit deny @<span class="o">{</span>HOME<span class="o">}</span>/.aws/<span class="o">{</span>,**<span class="o">}</span> mrkwl,
<span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Docker needs to be able to do bind mounts and this causes us
problems: the directory ~/.aws can be bind mounted to, say, ~/target/. The contents of ~/.aws will be available at ~/target and, crucially, will be considered by AppArmor to not match
the deny rule</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">audit deny @<span class="o">{</span>HOME<span class="o">}</span>/.aws/<span class="o">{</span>,**<span class="o">}</span> mrkwl,
</code></pre></div><p>Here&rsquo;s an example of (ab)using user namespaces to access secrets
in ~/.aws:</p>
<p><img src="/images/apparmorbypass/mount.gif#center" alt="user namespace bypass"></p>
<p>Here, a user namespace is created
from our &ldquo;bosh&rdquo; shell. ~/.aws is bind mounted
to ~/target and the file &ldquo;foo&rdquo; is copied. So,
if docker (or anything which can run docker) is compromised, then the AppArmor profile
isn&rsquo;t enough to protect files in ~/.aws.</p>
<h2 id="docker-impacts-apparmor-rules">Docker Impacts AppArmor Rules</h2>
<p>If you have non-rootless docker installed and your user has access to the docker socket,
the user has root access. For example, by running</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">docker run -it -v /:/root alpine /bin/sh
</code></pre></div><p>you drop into a shell as root with the host computer&rsquo;s root-filesystem available at /root.
You can now do whatever you like to the system: steal files, reset passwords,
create backdoor accounts, modify local logs to hide the intrusion etc.</p>
<p>With rootless-docker, the user in the container shell isn&rsquo;t root but the normal user account, even if &ldquo;whoami&rdquo; claims otherwise:</p>
<pre><code>/ # whoami
root
/ # cat /root/etc/shadow
cat: can't open '/root/etc/shadow': Permission denied
/ # 
</code></pre><p>The user is called &ldquo;root&rdquo; inside the container but is mapped to our normal, unprivileged user account and so /root/etc/shadow is off limits.</p>
<p>Although rootless-docker is an improvement from a security point of view, AppArmor profile
writers should be aware that access to the docker socket (/run/user/1000/docker.sock on my
system) allows file access rules to be bypassed. In the running example of protecting ~/.aws,
running the following (or driving the docker API in an equivalent way)</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">docker run --rm -v <span class="s2">&#34;</span><span class="nv">$HOME</span><span class="s2">&#34;</span>:/homecopy alpine /bin/sh -c <span class="s2">&#34;cp -R /homecopy/.aws /homecopy/awscopy&#34;</span>
</code></pre></div><p>copies the directory ~/.aws to ~/awscopy and the secrets therein are no longer protected by
the AppArmor profile.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>AppArmor profile writers should restrict access the docker socket unless it is required. If it is required, it should be noted that pathname based restrictions can be bypassed.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="is-this-a-bug">Is This A Bug?</h2>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s at least a very sharp-edge you could cut yourself on when writing AppArmor profiles
when user namespaces and bind mounts are in the mix.</p>
<p>Maybe the whole concept of controlling access by the filename is flawed? Maybe SELinux labels are
more appropriate for modern container setups?</p>
