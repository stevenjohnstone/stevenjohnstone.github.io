      <title>Golang: Panicking Safely</title>

      <description>Golang code can panic, causing availability issues, maybe even a denial of service vector. Compared to C and C++, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty innocuous. Still, denial of service is a serious issue: why not just use recover in all goroutines and keep the show on the road?
An Example Consider the following code:
// buggy reads data from input 16 bytes at a time, munges it and then writes it to output func buggy(input, output string) error { in, err := os.</description>

      <description>x86-64 Kata The book xchg rax,rax (content available free here) is a collection of 0x40 x86-64 snippets. It has no text other than chunks of assembly language. You read the code and ponder its meaning. Kata for the budding reverse engineer.
Spoiler Alert Program 0x03 is pretty neat:
Let me spoil this for you: at the end of this program, rax will contain the smaller of the original rax and rdx values.</description>

      <description>A Flaky Test I was investigating a test which failed with a very low probability. It boiled down to this:
package main import ( &amp;#34;net&amp;#34; &amp;#34;time&amp;#34; ) func main() { //port zero means let the OS choose a free port 	l, err := net.Listen(&amp;#34;tcp&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;127.0.0.1:0&amp;#34;) if err != nil { panic(err) } addr := l.Addr().String() go func() { for { c, err := l.Accept() if err != nil { return } c.</description>

      <description>Golang, File Descriptors and Finalizers If you Open() a file in Golang and it goes out of scope, then it&amp;rsquo;ll be closed the next time the garbage collector runs as there&amp;rsquo;s a cleanup finalizer set when Open() is called.
You can see this in action in the following program:
package main import ( &amp;#34;fmt&amp;#34; &amp;#34;os&amp;#34; &amp;#34;runtime&amp;#34; ) func allocate() int { //use this file as our test subject 	_, sourceFile, _, ok := runtime.</description>

      <description>I Went Looking For A STARTTLS Bug I&amp;rsquo;ve been putting together a cryptography course for my colleagues which focuses on mistakes. Its working title is Cryptography Done Wrong which should give you an idea of the tone. There&amp;rsquo;s a wealth of examples of systems assembled from sound cryptographic components which end up with security issues (for some definition of secure).
Over the years, TLS has been an excellent source of examples for such a course.</description>
