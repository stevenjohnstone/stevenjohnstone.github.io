      <description>I Went Looking For A STARTTLS Bug I&amp;rsquo;ve been putting together a cryptography course for my colleagues which focuses on mistakes. Its working title is Cryptography Done Wrong which should give you an idea of the tone. There&amp;rsquo;s a wealth of examples of systems assembled from sound cryptographic components which end up with security issues (for some definition of secure).
Over the years, TLS has been an excellent source of examples for such a course.</description>
