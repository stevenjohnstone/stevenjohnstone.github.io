      <description>I stumbled across a blog from a really interesting pioneer of computing, David S Maynard. This post about a probability puzzle nerd-sniped me. The problem statement is:
Imagine we have a deck of 52 standard playing cards. First question: How many cards do we have to draw until we can be sure that we have four of a kind? In other words: What is the minimum number of cards we must draw until we can be certain that four of those cards are the same kind?</description>
