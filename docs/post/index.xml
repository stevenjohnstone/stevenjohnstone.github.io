      <description>I have autism. I&amp;rsquo;m high-functioning. I went far in education and have had success in employment. That&amp;rsquo;s a big deal given the depressing statistics. In a sense, I&amp;rsquo;m outing myself online.
In a cliched autistic move, I&amp;rsquo;m going to list things which make me a bit different from the &amp;ldquo;average person&amp;rdquo;, should such a person exist. Partly, this is to get my own thoughts straight about this. I have only really known for a small fraction of my life and though family and friends think it&amp;rsquo;s obvious (in hindsight) it&amp;rsquo;s hard for me to accept that I have what is essentially a disability.</description>
