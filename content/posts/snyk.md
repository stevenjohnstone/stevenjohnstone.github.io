[Snyk](https://snyk.io) is a CNA for Golang packages (and other popular languages). When I learned that they'd accept vulnerability reports, I decided to
[try them](https://snyk.io/vulnerability-disclosure/) out with a couple of old bugs which I'd reported but got no response from the project author.

The turnaround on these issues was very quick (a couple of hours, on a weekend no less) and there are now two CVEs assigned:
[CVE-2020-7711](https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-GOLANG-GITHUBCOMRUSSELLHAERINGGOXMLDSIG-608301) and [CVE-2020-7731](https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-GOLANG-GITHUBCOMRUSSELLHAERINGGOSAML2-608302).
