[TIS-100](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIS-100) is nerd-heaven. Competing against friends on Steam had me fall into
a vortex for a few days over Christmas. So far, I've avoided spoilers and solutions on the internets and don't want to add any.
The fun really is in finding your own solutions.

I've thought up a couple of TIS-100 hobby projects to try when I have the time and inspiration. Maybe someone has done it already but that's not
really the point. I don't have any pressing need for tools for TIS-100 but I could learn a lot from [building](https://github.com/angea/pocorgtfo/blob/master/contents/issue02.pdf#page=3) them.

## Modelling Solutions with TLA+/PlusCal

It'd be interesting to model solutions with [TLA+](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TLA%2B) or [PlusCal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlusCal), building whatever intermediate tools are necessary. After all, TIS-100 is a distributed system with very constrained computers as nodes. This could make for a very fun course on formal methods for distributed systems.

## SSA

I'd like to have a shot at writing a compiler that'd transform TIS-100 code in [SSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_single_assignment_form) form.
Once in that form, the likes of [z3](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3) could be leveraged to check if a solution satisfies various constraints (like solving the problem). Something along the lines of [this](/posts/xchg-rax-rax) post.

Maybe this would be a chance to explore [LLVM](https://www.llvm.org/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/index.html) a bit deeper? Maybe I'd just build something from scratch just for a laugh? We'll see.
