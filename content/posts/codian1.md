## Introduction

I've spent most of my career in startups which would go on to be acquired by Cisco (twice). As a cheap form of therapy, I'm
collecting some of my "learnings" here.

## Ancient History

I joined [Codian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tandberg#Codian) in the summer of 2006. I was nearing completion of my PhD, had a one-year old child and far too much student debt.
I'd decided that I didn't want to follow an academic career. Or maybe I just couldn't afford to bring up a family on a post-doc
stipend. Take your pick. I'd been looking at the usual destinations for mathematics graduates (financial institutions etc) and it all
seemed a bit soulless. 

A recruiter hooked me up with Codian; I was told that Codian made some kind of hi-fi equipment and were looking
for someone to write code *or something* (I couldn't believe this guy got kilopounds when I took the job). Turned out, Codian were a startup in video conferencing and were looking for
someone to automate their manufacturing test systems. Eventually. But I'd have to *turn the handle* on some very hands on processes in the
day to day manufacturing of very specialised computer systems. As I automated things, I'd free up time from manual labour which could be
used to do more automation and so on in a virtuous cycle.

It'd be easy to rationalise why I joined with the hindsight of making some
money on acquisition, starting a career path in low-level systems programming and eventually security work but that'd be just making up
a story. I joined because I didn't know any better. Could have easily been a disaster.

I learned a lot from Codian: some bad, much good. I got off to a good start.

## Manufacturing at Small Scale

Codian made [MCUs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multipoint_control_unit) like this:

These are embedded systems with, for the time, a lot of DSP compute. Codian designed them, wrote software for them and built them (with help from specialist
manufacturers).

At the point I joined, all parts on the [BOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_of_materials) were purchased and stored in our manufacturing cave in [Langley](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@51.5086887,-0.5445945,3a,75y,36.62h,83.69t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sHxMLF51J5M3WYgaomPiGTg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656). This was high-value,
low output manufacturing and it isn't entirely mental to be quite hands on in the early years. As builds were scheduled at our manufacturer, [SMS](https://www.smselectronics.com/), parts were picked (literally, by hand), boxed and sent via FedEx. Even the metal cases fabricated at our "metal basher" would be sent to us, stored, picked and sent on to SMS. Assembled systems would be delivered from SMS where we'd perform testing by running various pieces of software and checking for errors (what I'd been hired to improve). Finally, purchased systems would be packaged up and sent to customers. All this with a staff of three (including me) when I joined.

## Life Choices

Much of the goods-in came on [pallets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pallet) and by my first day we'd amassed a large stockpile which was becoming a bit of a problem. My boss at the time gave me an electric sabre saw (we had a large collection of power tools for *reasons*) and told me to chop up the pallets and put them in the garbage. *This was my first assigned task in my new career*.

So, I'm in the car park on a nice sunny day having an amazingly good time dismembering pallets like I'm Ash in [Army of Darkness](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106308/) . Some minutes in I'm halfway through destroying
pallets when a truck appears and an irate (but salt of the earth) fella approaches me to ask why I'm destroying _his_ pallets. For a brief moment,
I thought he might punch me but I was apologetic and wielding a saw. I directed him to talk to my boss and went for lunch to ponder my life choices.

My first impressions of Codian were that it was chaos. In hindsight, I can see that it was order I'd failed to understand. More on that later.
