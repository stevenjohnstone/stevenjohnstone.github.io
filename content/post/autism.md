I have [autism](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/autism/signs/adults/). I'm [high-functioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-functioning_autism). I went far in education and have had success
in employment. That's a big deal given the [depressing statistics](https://www.autistica.org.uk/news/autistic-people-highest-unemployment-rates). In a sense, I'm outing myself
online.

In a [cliched autistic](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2008.0324) move, I'm going to list things which make me a bit different from the "average person", [should such a person exist](https://www.thestar.com/news/insight/2016/01/16/when-us-air-force-discovered-the-flaw-of-averages.html). Partly, this is to get my own thoughts straight about this. I have only really
known for a small fraction of my life and though family and friends think it's obvious (in hindsight) it's hard
for me to accept that I have what is essentially a _disability_.

## Anxiety

[Anxiety](https://www.autism.org.uk/advice-and-guidance/topics/mental-health/anxiety) in autistic people appears to be a common complaint. At various points in my life, anxiety has been life-limiting. In my opinion, anxiety itself is harmless though very uncomfortable. What is harmful are the coping strategies around anxiety which pretty much amount to [avoidance](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-are-avoidance-behaviors-3024312) of
people or situations which may provoke anxiety. Layered on top of this is a desire to hide anxiety for fear of
appearing weak or a coward.

At this point in my life, I accept anxiety as a side-effect of doing challenging stuff. What's challenging for me
may seem quite trivial to some. Funnily enough, what's hard for some people is really straight-forward for me.

## I Get Lost in Airports

At [Schiphol](https://www.schiphol.nl/en/) airport, much to the amusement of my wife, I did two circuits of arrivals before finding the exit to baggage reclaim. It wasn't the first time I've gotten lost in an airport and
hopefully won't be the last.

I find some forms of human communication to be ambiguous and confusing. In particular, signage for directions
is, for me, ambiguous. Does the arrow point straight down or behind me? Straight forward or in front? Next exit
when I'm two metres from the literal next exit doing 120km/h? Not exactly life-limiting unless I follow satnav
too literally but a curious view into how my brain functions.

## I'm Terrible With Names

I have a very good recall of faces. I can remember large numbers of facts about people I've met. I just [can't remember](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism_and_memory) their names. I feel awful when I fail to recall someone's name; it's not personal. If I've known you
a long time, then I'll know your name but sometimes I may stumble. Best to laugh it off.

My theory is that names in the languages I speak are

* pretty meaningless
* aren't unique to the person

As a naming convention, it'd not pass code-review.

## I Can't Stand Velvet

Autism is associated with [sensory overload](https://www.pavpub.com/the-anger-box). I can handle loud noises, I'm reasonably okay with crowds
and parties but for whatever reason, my brain recoils in horror at velvet. It's hard to describe exactly how bad
this is but when I see people react to nails on a chalkboard, I imagine they are feeling what I feel.

## I Don't Do Business Dress

I never wear suits. I cut internal labels off clothes. I hate the feeling of anything touching my throat. I have no idea how I survived high-school with its [ridiculous uniform](https://blogs.glowscotland.org.uk/nl/public/CHSFP/uploads/sites/114/2015/05/CHS_Uniform_Leaflet-2015.pdf). It's not some statement about conformity or some
such. The sensation of wearing these types clothes is uncomfortable to point of torture.

## Detail

I need to know all the details. I find it very hard to accept something as a fact without knowing all the supporting ideas. Some would call it pedantry. A more positive spin is to realise that I'm actually super interested in your idea and want to know _everything_.

## Focus (Obsession)

If you tell me about something interesting, it may circle in my brain for days and weeks. It can hum away in
the background while I'm happily doing other things. I'm easy to [nerd snipe](https://xkcd.com/356/). I may get back to you a long time
after with many questions after I've thought the shit out of it.

The downside of focus is that I may neglect other less interesting activities like sleep, exercise and tidying
up after myself. To counter this I exploit the power of habits e.g I have a to-do app which schedules exercise and
I just do what it tells me. Simple.

## I Suck At Interviews

If there's code to be written or maths to be mangled, I can't do it while in a novel social situation or being timed. This is particularly debilitating in an interview or exam situation. It means that simple coding exercises end up with me going into a kind
of fight-or-flight stupor. This has happened to me a few times. It's an odd feeling to get feedback that you
_can't code_ when you have evidence to the contrary on your hard drive.

Many times in my career, I have coded solutions to complex problems under time constraints with _severe consequences for failure_. After all, I've worked in high-agency roles in startups where messing something up could be company ending. What derails me is the social novelty and the time constraint that is _only there to measure you_. So, on balance, I feel quite okay that I'm shit in an
interview because I don't think it's a fair reflection of what I have to offer. I feel bad about the missed
opportunities though and I'd be lying if I said I didn't feel bad about appearing incompetent.

Exams at school and university were slightly easier to handle. You rarely talk to someone you haven't already met
and the time is usually on the order of hours so I had plenty of opportunity to calm down.

## I Do Understand People, Honest

I suspect that I understand people quite well but it feels like work and I'm doing it consciously like a learned
task. The human face and body sends a mass of signals which contradict what people are saying. I find that when I'm listening I am concentrating really hard on all the cues so I don't misunderstand.

Trouble is, people tell very many harmless lies e.g.

Q. How are you?
A. Fine.

Body language and context are often at odds with speech. If you're really trying to understand people, there's a
lot to process.

I have a theory that non-autistic people can have spectacularly bad social skills but

* believe the contrary
* don't feel anxiety about upsetting people

If I've had to do a lot of socialising with strangers, I feel tired. I think that's not much different from introverts.
