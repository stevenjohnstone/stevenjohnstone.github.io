I am/have been

* a [mathematician](https://www.gla.ac.uk/research/az/cmals/)
* a [Codian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codian), [Tandberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tandberg), [Cisco](https://cisco.com), [Acano](https://www.acano.com/) and [Jazz Networks](https://jazznetworks.com) alum
* an automation engineer, embedded systems engineer, security specialist, [CSO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_security_officer).

Apart from brief periods after acquisition, my entire professional life has been in startups. I've done a wide variety of things to build these companies:

* automated production line tests
* wrote processor bootstrap code for embedded systems
* ported operating systems
* rolled custom linux distributions
* wrote kernel drivers
* tinkered with FPGAs
* optimised network stacks
* tracked down silicon bugs
* hunted security flaws
* built auth systems
* ran [PSIRTs](https://www.first.org/education/FIRST_PSIRT_Service_Framework_v1.0)

I know how to program in

* Golang
* C
* C++
* x86-64 assembler
* Ruby

After years of suffering C++ as a systems/platform language, I switched to Golang in 2015 and never looked back.

I know some weird stuff and think some of it is worth recording, if only for me.
